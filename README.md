# Bus-Tracker
This project shows real time tracking of buses near MIT. The code allows for automatic updates every 15 seconds. This had initially been completed in December and when refiguring, the API had expired. This incorporates a fresh API for proper map loading.
Future goals for this project will be to incorporate bus numbers and possible links to stops on the routes.
